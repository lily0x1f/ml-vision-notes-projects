#ML Concepts
### Loss Functions
It is the method evaluating how well an algorithm models the dataset. (Compares predictions and actual data)

Different types of loss functions

Mean Squared error

What is outlier? -> check this

### Gradient Descent

An optimization technique to minimize the loss iterativly change wight and bias. 

What is 
### loss curve
, and what does it mean? Helps determining when model is converging or overfitting. 

Loss functions for linear models produce a convex surface->check this
