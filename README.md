#ML Concepts
### Loss Functions
It is the method evaluating how well an algorithm models the dataset. (Compares predictions and actual data)

Different types of loss functions

Mean Squared error

What is outlier? -> check this

### Gradient Descent

An optimization technique to minimize the loss iterativly change wight and bias. 

### loss curve
Helps determining when model is converging or overfitting. 

Loss functions for linear models produce a convex surface->check this

HYPERPARAMETERS

Values we can control are hyperparameters.(external configuration) -> model architecture, learning rate, model complexity, epoch, batch size
Tuning them is important (check when learning rate is too high model bounces) -> techniques for tuning Bayesian optimization, Grid search, Random search...
